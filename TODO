Add a "firefox-settings" role
- Create a default profile if none exist
- Apply settings to a user.js file in each available profile
- Settings would be things you can specify in about:config
- See https://braheezy.github.io/posts/automating-firefox-with-ansible/

Add further tmux customizations
- Start "home" and "work" tmux sessions on user login
  See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Tmux#Autostart_with_systemd
- Auto-attach to a tmux session based on current workspace?
  - Check XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP for a desktop session
  - Make sure we're not already in a tmux session
  - Make sure there are no other clients attached to the session
  - Match tmux session to current workspace name
    - Preconfigure workspace names "home", "work", "misc"
    - Use "wmctrl -d | awk '$2 == "*" { print $10 }'" to print the current workspace
- Configure session-specific options / windows / panes based on session name?
